# 12: Client-side Routing w/ PageJS

**Author**: Ozge and Jordan
**Version**: 1.1.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- We are trying to use PageJS to create a single page application. Meaning we want all our content to be under one html, but we want to view one piece of content while hiding the others, then as we navigate, we want to remain on the same page, but have our content filtered based on what we are trying to do-->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- We are using a client to display our content and a server to put and get requests from a database. We are using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, nodejs, express, pagejs, pg, and SQL. -->
